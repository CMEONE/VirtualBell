        <h1>Why Harker Middle School Virtual Bell?</h1>
        <h6 style="color: lightgray">Why should you use THIS bell as opposed to the other solutions such as WhatNow or
            TogaTech's HarkerMSBell?</h6>

                <li>
                    It's open source! You can browse the source on <a href="https://github.com/ROTARTSI82/VirtualBell">GitHub!</a>
                    And why is open source the
                    way to go? <a href="https://opensource.google/docs/why/">Just ask Google!</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It has all the features! We have all the features offered by TogaTech's HarkerMSBell, in addition
                    to most of the features offered by WhatNow. The only thing that WhatNow offers that we don't have
                    is the ability to set alerts, and that may be changing shortly!
                </li>
                <li>
                    It looks nice! We use Bootstrap, the world's most popular open-source CSS library.
                    The "Official" solution offered by TogaTech's HarkerMSBell is rather bare-bones compared to
                    the rest of the competition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's made by a Grant, a 7th grader. WhatNow was made by Dr. Linton. Even then, it is still able to
                    compete with WhatNow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kabir, an 8th grader, is the owner of TogaTech and creator of HarkerMSBell.
                    He has abused his power as a member of LID Council and made his incomplete solution the "Official"
                    solution,
                    rather than the objectively better and more complete solution like WhatNow or even our solution.
